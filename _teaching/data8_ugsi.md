I have been an undergraduate student instructor (UGSI) for STAT/CS/INFO C8 (commonly referred to as Data8) for the following semesters:
* Fall 2017, taught by [John Denero](denero.org) and [David Wagner](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw/)
* Spring 2018, taught by Ani Adhikari(https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~ani/)
* Fall 2018, taught by [David Wagner](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw/) and [Ramesh Sridharan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rameshvs/)

As a UGSI, my duties include:
 * Leading a two-hour lab session, which consists of a discussion worksheet
and a jupyter notebook assignment.
 * Holding weekly office hours for students to ask questions and receive help.
 * Assisting the professors in developing assignments.

In Fall 2018, I joined the pedagogy team, where I and several other UGSI’s 
reviewed the course’s discussion and tutor worksheets to ensure that each question
succinctly conveyed the necessary concepts.
