I was a tutor for STAT/CS/INFO C8 (commonly referred to as Data8), taught by [John Denero](http://denero.org/). 

Data8 teaches basic programming and statistical concepts to enable students with no prior technical experience to gain data analytical skills.  

In Fall 2018, 1300 students from over 60 different majors enrolled in the course.
  
My duties as a tutor included:
 * Leading two 45-minute small group tutoring sections per week, where I gave
mini concept lectures and guided 4-5 students through that weekâ€™s tutoring
worksheet.
 * Holding weekly office hours for students to ask questions and receive help.
 * Grading student assignments.
