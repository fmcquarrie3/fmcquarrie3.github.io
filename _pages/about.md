Hello! I'm Frances McQuarrie, but I prefer to go by Francie.   

I am a third year undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley working towards a Statistics major and Computer Science minor.   

Spring 2019 will be my fourth semester as an Undergraduate Student Instructor (UGSI) for STAT/CS/INFO C8: Foundations of Data Science. I discovered Data Science when I first came to UC Berkeley and have been fascinated with it ever since.
