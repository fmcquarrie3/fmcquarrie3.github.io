I have been an undergraduate student instructor (UGSI) for STAT/CS/INFO C8 (commonly referred to as Data8) for the following semesters:
* Fall 2017, taught by [John Denero](denero.org) and [David Wagner](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw/)
* Spring 2018, taught by [Ani Adhikari](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~ani/)
* Fall 2018, taught by [David Wagner](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw/) and [Ramesh Sridharan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rameshvs/)
* Spring 2019, taught by [Ani Adhikari](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~ani/) and [Will Fithian](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~wfithian/)

As a UGSI, my duties included:
 * Leading a two-hour lab session, which consists of a discussion worksheet
and a jupyter notebook assignment.
 * Holding weekly office hours for students to ask questions and receive help.
 * Assisting the professors in developing assignments.

In addition to the above, I spent Spring 2018 assisting the grading team with running autograders and resolving issues, Fall 2018 assisting the pedagogy team in ensuring course content covered relevant material in a precise manner, and Spring 2019 assisting the support team in managing our 100+ Lab Assistants.
