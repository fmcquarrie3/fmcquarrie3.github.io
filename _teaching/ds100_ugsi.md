I  was a 20 hour/week undergraduate student instructor (UGSI) for STAT/CS/INFO CS100 (commonly referred to as Data 100) in Spring 2020, under Professor [Ani Adhikari](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~ani/) and Professor [Joseph Gonzalez](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jegonzal/).

This course intends to provide the necessary foundation and context in statistics and computing to prepare students for further courses in machine learning, such as CS189. After its initial offering in Spring 2017, Data 100 has undergone many transformations to discover the right balance of topics to advance students' knowledge beyond Data 8 and prepare them for future statistical tasks, whether it's in CS189 or future personal projects. In spring 2020, Professor Adhikari tied concepts more closely with what students learned in Data 8. 

As a lead UGSI, I assisted with developing and maintaining the logistical backend of the course, from exams, grading extensions, and acccommodations in the Disabled Students Program. In addition, I held weekly discussion sections, laboratory sections, and office hours.
