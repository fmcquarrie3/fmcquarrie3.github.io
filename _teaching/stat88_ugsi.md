I was a 20 hour/week undergraduate student instructor (UGSI) for STAT 88 in Fall 2019, under Professor [Ani Adhikari](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~ani/).

This was the first offering of a  "revamped" version of the course, after its initial conception in Fall 2016. The new version was tied much more closely to the content of Data 8, its connector course, and to computational tools such as NumPy and SciPy. The course intends to provide students of all backgrounds the basic mathematical and probabilistic tools for the statistical analyses required across a variety of disciplines. It also further expands on the mathematics of certain concepts discussed in Data 8. 

As a lead UGSI, I assisted in developing the new course [webiste](http://stat88.org/),  the hosting platform for the [textbook](http://stat88.org/textbook/notebooks/intro), pedagocial content,  and administrative tasks, in addition to weekly leading of discussion sections and office hours.
